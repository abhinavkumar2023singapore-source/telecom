# TODO List for Fixing Backend Support Issue

- [x] Edit abc.py to save model and scaler with correct names ('telecom_model.pkl' and 'telecom_scaler.pkl')
- [x] Re-run abc.py to regenerate the pickle files with updated names
- [ ] Retrain model with current sklearn version to resolve version incompatibility
- [ ] Test the backend by running app.py and making a prediction request to ensure it works
